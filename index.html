                                        I completed a dual degree program at Montclair State University receiving both
                                        my Bachelor of Arts in Political Science as well as my Bachelor of Arts in
                                        Phycology in May of 2014.
                                        <br />Directly after finishing my degrees I enrolled in Rutgers University
                                        Coding Camp where I received my full-stack web development certification in May
                                        of 2016.<br />
                                        I choose this niche to apply my degrees because I firmly believe(d) that coding,
                                        website and application development and creative energy would be the future of
                                        both political science as well as psychology.
